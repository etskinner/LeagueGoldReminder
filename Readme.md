# LeagueGoldReminder
A text-to-speech reminder of how much gold you have in League of Legends

If you have trouble remembering to spend your gold in League of Legends, this can help! 
It reminds via text-to-speech you when you go over certain thresholds (1000, 1500, 2000, and so on). 
The reminders get more frequent the higher you go. 

## Install

### LeagueGoldReminder.exe / Portable
The easiest way to run this is to download and run LeagueGoldReminder.exe from the Releases page.

### Python
If you're familiar with python and git:
- Clone the repository
- Install requirements.txt
- Run LeagueGoldReminder.py

## Usage
Just run the file (.py or .exe)! There isn't any configurability right now. Maybe there will be in the future. The window shows some info log messages, but that's about it.
